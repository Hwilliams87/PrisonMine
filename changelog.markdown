------------------------------

## PrisonMine 1.21 ##

### Compatibility ###

+ CraftBukkit 1.4.7-R0.1
+ PrisonSuite 1.3

### Changes ###

+ Fixed a critical bug that prevented signs from being updated after the server is restarted or plugins are reloaded
+ Fixed a bug that caused automatic resets to be marked as manual
+ Fixed a bug that caused resets triggered by button click to be marked as manual
+ Fixed numerous bugs that affected proper parsing of variables in some cases
+ Moved the option to silence the mine notifications to flags
+ Fixed a bug that prevented invalid tasks from being cancelled properly
+ Fixed flag information missing from the mine info screen
+ Debug commands now have a permission: `prison.mine.debug`

### Known caveats ###

+ While the mines are no longer prone to indefinite reset loops, their timers may still jam. The reset time will freeze and will not change until the server is restarted, or the plugins are reloaded through /reload. This is a known issue and is being worked on.

------------------------------

## PrisonMine 1.2 ##

### Compatibility ###

+ CraftBukkit 1.4.7-R0.1
+ PrisonSuite 1.3

### Changes ###

+ Updated to work with CB 1.4.7-R0.1.
+ Flags Three new options were added to the mines: `SurfaceOre`, `SuperTools`, `NoToolDamage`.
+ New command: `/mine time <mineId>`. Similar to `/mine info`, but this command will only output the time until the mine has to reset.
+ New configuration option: `reset-mines-on-restart`. False by default, this mine will cause all mines to reset when the plugin is being loaded (reset or reload)
+ Completely removed the unused extension system
+ Fixed a critical bug that caused timers to jam, resulting in mines being reset indefinitely
+ Permissions to build and destroy blocks in mines default to `true` now: server owners, take notice
+ Fixed a bug that prevented reset warnings from appearing in chat
+ Fixed a bug that caused duplicate timers to be added for one mine
+ Fixed a bug that caused errors to appear after deleting mines that had children
+ Fixed event listener issues that resulted in PrisonMine overwriting WorldGuard protection
+ Fixed an issue that caused incorrect name to be registered as CommandSender
+ Fixed a bug that caused "ghost timers" after deleting a mine

### Known caveats ###

+ While the mines are no longer prone to indefinite reset loops, their timers may still jam. The reset time will freeze and will not change until the server is restarted, or the plugins are reloaded through `/reload`. This is a known issue and is being worked on.
+ Display signs are bugged in this version and will not work! A fix will be released shortly.

------------------------------
